11. Missing features:

        We would have liked to add more interactions and recipes to the similator,
        such as chopping, boiling and frying. These certainely would be the kinds of
        additions we would make in future updates with more time. 
        
        We wrote a Chop script, Chop.cs, which switches out the prefabs as they collide
        with the knife

12. Bugs in your code and in any system you used:

        One thing we noticed was that the pan shakes on the stove while cooking.
